IMAGE RECOGNITION WITH IBM CLOUD VISUAL RECOGNITION #PROJECT OVERVIEW: #The "Image Recognition with IBM Cloud Visual Recognition" project aims to develop an image recognition system using IBM Cloud Visual Recognition, providing users with the capability to analyze and describe the content of uploaded images #SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: #User Interface (Web Application) IBM Cloud Visual Recognition Custom Classifier IBM Cloud Foundry Web Application Backend IBM Cloud Services #DESIGN THINKING : Design thinking principles can be applied to the initial setup of the IBM Cloud Visual Recognition service and obtaining the necessary API keys to ensure a user-centered and problem-solving approach. Here's how you can approach this setup with design thinking in mind

DEVELOPMENT: from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator from ibm_watson import VisualRecognitionV3

app = Flask(__name)

Set up the Visual Recognition service

authenticator = IAMAuthenticator('YOUR_API_KEY') visual_recognition = VisualRecognitionV3( version='2018-03-19', authenticator=authenticator ) visual_recognition.set_service_url(' https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=cat')

@app.route('/') def index(): return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST']) def upload(): uploaded_file = request files['file']

if uploaded_file.filename != '':
    classes = visual_recognition.classify(uploaded_file).get_result()
    return jsonify(classes)
else:
    return jsonify({'error': 'No file uploaded'})
if name == 'main': app.run()

Deploy to IBM Cloud Foundry: applications:

name: APP_NAME memory: 256M buildpacks:
python_buildpack path: .
Run the following commands to deploy the app to IBM Cloud Foundry:

cf login -a https://api.ng.ibmcloud.net cf push OUTPUT: { "images": [ { "classifiers": [ { "classifier_id": "default", "name": "default", "classes": [ { "class": "cat", "score": 0.972, "type_hierarchy": "/animal/mammal/domestic cat" }, { "class": "mammal", "score": 0.972 }, { "class": "animal", "score": 0.972 } ] } ], "source_url": "sample.jpg" } ], "images_processed": 1, "custom_classes": 0 } OUTCOME: The primary outcome of the project is a robust image recognition system that empowers users with an accessible, accurate, and engaging tool for understanding and interpreting visual content. It brings the power of IBM Cloud Visual Recognition to a diverse range of industries and applications, creating a valuable bridge between the visual world and human understanding.

CONCLUSION: In this project, we successfully developed an image recognition system using IBM Cloud Visual Recognition. Our system can analyze and identify objects and scenes within images, enabling users to obtain meaningful information from their visual content. We created a user-friendly application that allows users to upload images and receive instant recognition results.The project demonstrated the potential of image recognition in various applications, including content moderation, object identification, and scene analysis. The system's accuracy and performance were evaluated through testing, ensuring reliable results.Continuous maintenance and model updates are essential for keeping the system up-to-date and improving its recognition capabilities. User feedback and ongoing data collection will guide future enhancements.
